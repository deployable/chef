This file is reset every time a new release is done. This file describes changes that have not yet been released.

### --run-lock-timeout for chef-client and chef-solo
You can now add a timeout for the maximum time a client run waits on another client run to finish.
The default is to wait indefinitely.
Setting the run lock timeout to 0 causes the second client run to exit immediately.

This can be configured in your config file:
```
run_lock_timeout SECONDS
```

Or via the command line:
```
chef-client --run-lock-timeout SECONDS
```

#### New knife command: knife node environment set
You can now easily set the environment for an existing node without editing the node object:

```
knife node environment set NODE ENVIRONMENT
```
### New configurable knife bootstrap options for chef-full template
You can now modify the chef-full template with the following options in `knife bootstrap`:

* `--bootstrap-install-sh URL` fetches and executes an installation bash script from the provided URL.
* `--bootstrap-wget-options OPTIONS` and `--bootstrap-curl-options OPTIONS` allow arbitrary options to be added to wget and curl.
* `--bootstrap-install-command COMMAND` can be used to execute a custom chef-client installation command sequence. Take note that this cannot be used in conjunction with the above options.

### Parallelize cookbook synchronization

You can now synchronize your cookbooks faster by parallelizing the process. You can specify the number of helper threads in your config file with `cookbook_sync_threads NUM_THREADS`. The default is 10. Increasing `NUM_THREADS` can result in gateway errors from the chef server (namely 503 and 504). If you are experiencing these often, consider decreasing `NUM_THREADS` to fewer than default.

### New chef config options: Whitelisting for the attributes saved by the node

You can now whitelist attributes that will be saved by the node by providing a hash with the keys you want to include. Whitelist filters are described for each attribute level: `automatic_attribute_whitelist`, `default_attribute_whitelist`, `normal_attribute_whitelist`, and `override_attribute_whitelist`.

If your automatic attribute data looks like
````
{
  "filesystem" => {
    "/dev/disk0s2" => {
      "size" => "10mb"
    },
    "map - autohome" => {
      "size" => "10mb"
    }
  },
  "network" => {
    "interfaces" => {
      "eth0" => {...},
      "eth1" => {...},
    }
  }
}
````
and your config file looks like
````
automatic_attribute_whitelist = ["network/interfaces/eth0"]
````
then the entire `filesystem` and `eth1` subtrees will not be saved by the node. To save the `/dev/disk0s2` subtree, you must write `automatic_attribute_whitelist = [ ["filesystem", "/dev/disk0s2"] ]`.

If your config file looks like `automatic_attribute_whitelist = []`, then none of your automatic attribute data will be saved by the node.

The default behavior is for the node to save all the attribute data. This can be ensured by setting your whitelist filter to `nil`.

We recommend only using `automatic_attribute_whitelist` to reduce the size of the system data being stored for nodes, and discourage the use of the other attribute whitelists except by advanced users.
